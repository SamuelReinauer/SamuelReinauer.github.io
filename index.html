            <h3>What does it take to be a Dictator:</h3>
            <p>Every dictator should possess the qualities of being ruthless, power hungry, and a public speaker because Hitler didn’t like jews and foreigners, he kept asking for more and more power, and his speeches made there small society look really big and terrifying. You have to be ruthless in order to become a dictator. Hitler for istantense did not like jews or foreigners when he was young. Later on this caused him to be ruthless and kill almost every single Jew in Germany. You also have to be a power hungry. If you keep asking for power you will eventually keep getting it and before you know it you will be one of the top leaders in the world. If you can not speak to the public with confidence you will not get power and you will just keep falling between the cracks. If you are a good speaker then you can make your society look enormous and terrifying like what hitler did.

	           How to be a good dictator, and I mean ruthless. A dictator has to find a country that is economically, politically and socially poor. A dictator wants to find a country that is falling because they want to save it and make all of the people excited. A good dictator is when they are ruthless, power hungry and a public speaker. This makes a good dictator because they are saving a country that is about to fall through the cracks and then before you know it, it is the strongest country in the world. A good dictator should help a falling economy, a political government, and a social government. 
                <br>
                <br>
	           A dictator should help a falling economy because they need to recover it and make the people excited. A dictator needs to save the economy and bring the country back onto it’s feet. For instance that is what Hitler did to Germany and by the end of the war, Germany was completely fine and had a ton of power. Secondly, during this time in Germany hyperinflation was going on. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia they said, “This hyperinflationary period combined with the effects of the Great Depression (beginning in 1929) to seriously undermine the stability of the German economy, wiping out the personal savings of the middle class and spurring massive unemployment” (Holocaust Encyclopedia, paragraph 1).  This quote is saying that when everybody lost their money the businesses rose the prices of their products, causing the middle class to lose all of their money. Third, the dictator also needs to fix all the poor people in the country and bring the prices of food and other items down. A dictator needs to fix this because people are wasting all of their money on food, with no jobs, causing them to starve. This is one of the reasons what makes a good dictator. 
                <br>
                <br>
	           A dictator has to find a political government that is failing. The dictator needs to have a lot of money and power in order to succeed. You need to have power and money to bring the economy back up and to be able to order something right there and there and it’s done. A good dictator also has to blame someone if something bad happens. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia they said, “Agitators from the political left served heavy prison sentences for inspiring political unrest”(Holocaust Encyclopedia, paragraph 6). This quote says that people got in prison because they didn’t do something that the dictator wanted them to do. You need money to be a good dictator. You need money to bring the economy out of poverty. This is why the government needs money to bring the economy out of poverty and to be able to do it right there on the spot. 
                <br>
                <br>
	           A dictator needs a social government in order to have the people be happy at you. The dictator of the country wants the people of the country to feel sad and hopeless. The dictator needs them to feel this way for they can recover the economy and make the people feel like the dictator is their hero. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia they said, “It helped to further discredit German socialist and liberal circles who felt most committed to maintain Germany's fragile democratic experiment.” (Holocaust Encyclopedia, paragraph, 4). This explains that Germany needed a socialist in order to succeed and not focus on one thing. Lastly, the dictator needs the people to be sad. If the people are sad and can’t do anything the dictator can do anything that they want. This is why the dictator wants the people to feel sad and hopeless for they can do anything they want. 
                <br>
                <br>
	           The dictator needs a economy that is falling in order to bring it back up onto it’s feet. If the economy ever fails then the people need to elect a president that is a dictator. The dictator needs to have money and power to bring the economy out of poverty. The country will get out of poverty by itself but it will take a long time. That is why the people elect a dictator to speed up the process. A dictator also needs a social government because they need the people to feel sad. When the dictator recovers the economy they will be really happy. The dictator wants the people to be happy for they can pretty much get away with everything and anything. All together this is what makes up a good dictator. A good dictator needs to find a falling economy, a political government, and a social government. The people need to read this in order to understand what goes on in a dictator government.
